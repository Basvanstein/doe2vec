Title
- Structural Bias in Optimization Algorithm Components

A description of scope and content. These details will be displayed on the website as the default description for the tutorial if it is accepted.

    Benchmarking heuristic algorithms is vital to understand under which conditions and on what kind of problems certain algorithms perform well. 
    Most benchmarks are performance-based, to test algorithm performance under a wide set of conditions. There are also resource- and behaviour-based benchmarks to test the resource consumption and the behaviour of algorithms. 
    In this Tutorial, we focus on behaviour benchmarking of algorithms and more specifcally we focus in Structural Bias (SB).
    SB is a form of bias inherent to the iterative heuristic optimiser in the objective space that also affects the performance of the optimisation algorithm.
    Detecting whether, when and what type of SB occurs in a heuristic optimisation algorithm can provide guidance on what needs to be improved in these algorithms, besides helping to
    identify conditions under which such bias would not occur.
    In the tutorial we first give the problem definition of detecting and identifying different types of structural bias, including many visual examples.
    We then introduce different methods for bias detection and demo the BIAS toolkit.
    For many well-known and popular optimization heuristics we have analysed structural bias for different hyper-parameters, we give insights to these results and show best practises to avoid SB in algorithm development.
    Last, we showcase results on how SB might affect optimization results on popular benchmarks.
